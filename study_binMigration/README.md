The purpose of this study is to study bin migration effects in MC that can be used to determine how much we might be under(over)estimating the efficiency if we select on the generated quantities in the reconstructed MC.

A generated variable's value can be reconstructed with a spread = resolution
Values in one bin can migrate out/in
