Baryons are an important background in this channel. The strongest baryon signal is the Delta+(1232) seen in the pi0proton invariant mass spectrum. There are two additional higher Delta resonances and additional Nstar resonances that can be seen in the etaproton spectrum. 

These baryon backgrounds are real etapi0 events and can only be removed by how they populate phase space. Performing a longitudinal momentum analysis, van hove, might be a way to separate baryon contributions. The standard way is to simply perform a selection on the baryon-like mass spectrum but can be inefficient for smaller resonances. 

Peter wrote a paper with JPAC to perform a mass dependent van hove analysis which takes the isobar masses as an input to define specific regions to select on in the van hvoe angle. This is opposed to a strict sector selection. Here, I use a data driven approach to come up with a M(etapi) dependent van hove angle selection to remove the heavier deltas for the PWA of the a2.
