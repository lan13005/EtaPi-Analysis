The purpose of this study is to make an estimate of the cross section for f2 to pi0pi0 which is also a 4g final state similar my main analysis. Only the 2017 data is studied, the acceptance corrected f2 yield is fitted to extract the corrected yield which can then be used to estimate the cross section in the coherent peak on the interval t=[0.1,1.0]. The value quite smaller than the a2 cross section measured in etapi, coming out to around 12 nb whereas the a2 is more like 70. 

The cross section will be used to estimate the expected leakage into the etapi0 channel. The event selections can be mostly transferred over

The DSelector is an old version that was built for etapi0, so some variable names are not matching the current analysis. The format is much more complicated also
