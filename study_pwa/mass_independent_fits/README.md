Contains a set of scripts to do mass independent fits
1. divideData.pl takes some input root trees and splits them into different root files in different Metapi mass
2. drawAmptoolsVars.C takes in an amptools-input tree and computes some variables + histograms. Allows comparison of acceptance corrected results and generated
3. generate_cfg.py takes in a amptools cfg file as a base and appends lines to initialze any desired waveset
4. runFits.py is the main driver that will spawn multiple fit programs and aggregates the results with getAmpsInBin
- There is a script that executes multiple runFits (i.e. over multiple t-bins)
