draw.py will draw fit quality plots to show what the partial waves look like in various quantities and compares to the overall data

drawOverview.py is the main script that generates the final partial wave intensity plot, the cross sections, and parity asymmetry plots. It can take a few arguments, one is a bootstrap folder that contains the bootstrapped statistical errors. Another argument is the barlow.csv file which is generated by the runSystComparison.py file which can be found in one of the systematic_nominal folders. drawOverview.sh shows some possible set of commands to include various error bars

comareSyst.py is used by runSystComparison.py to draw the "systematics overview" plots and fit fractions plots

THE MOST IMPORTANT is helper.py. It contains some helper functions that is shared among the other programs to load in data and extract cross sections. It also contains global variables that determine the number of t-bins, their widths, and additional labels. It also loads in the theory data
