delta5NLL_dataBkgndAccmc - bootstraps data, bkgnd, and accmc to determine the precision
delta100NLL_dataBkgnd_accmc - bootstrap data,bkgnd to determine precision of sampling and accmc to determine MC integral precision

v1 - will boostrap the accmc alone for the lowest t-bin and highest t-bin. Compare the best solutions in each solution set
    1) lowest t-bin altMin worse by 5 NLL. altMin best of second cluster
        its the etapi_result_0.fit and etapi_result_2.fit
    2) highest t-bin altMin worse by 8 NLL. altMin best of second cluster

    v1 contains a nominal folder which should contain the drawn partial waves



The basis for this code, drawPlots.py, is found in a jupyter notebook
study_pwa/mass_dependent_fits/shared_results/malte_v5_bootstrap_accmc/bootstrap_quality.ipynb

This code is made standalone for future use

Currently, 
Two pairs of fits are made
One pair of fits differ by 100 NLL
Another pair differ by 5 NLL
Both pairs sees a precision of around 50 NLL
