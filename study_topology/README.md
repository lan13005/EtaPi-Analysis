When running over bggen, a generic photoproduction generator, you have access to the thrown topology information (any MC actually).
We can save the topology as an additional branch and plot any variables we wish

This is useful if one wishes to see how each simulation populates different quantities

For instance, you can make a stacked histogram of the invariant mass M(etapi) split into the different reaction topologies to see where/how different reactions leak in
