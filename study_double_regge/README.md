Code to study the double regge process. The goal is to extract the beam asymmetry in various kinematic bins


### NOTES 
Include a selection on teta<1 or tpi0<1

MAINLY FOR EVENT SELECTION SYSTEMATICS

No omega cut, not useful for DR studies
No Delta cut, nor VH, nor t cuts
8.2 < E < 8.8 do not check systematics of coherent peak selection
Select Double Regge region Mpi0eta [1.6, 3.0]

ChiSq<40 the nominal for Double Regge is 16
UE<10, basically freed
The double regge region is pretty clean and it shows in the little # events in UE and chiSq that has larger than nominal selections

Looser “standard” event selections
Same photon E selection (since its very tight already)
Same dEdx selection (weird to vary since its a functional form)
