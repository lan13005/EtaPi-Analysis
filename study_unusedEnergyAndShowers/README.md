Here we study how unused energy and unused showers differ

Unused energy allows a more fine grained control over the combinatorics as unused showers is discrete. We cannot easily increase by evvent yield by arbitrary amounts as we have to increase unused showers by integer values. 

There is an observed difference between data/MC for the unused energy distribution which does not appear to increase as fast as the data when loosening the unused energy selection

The jupyter-notebook backs these claims up
