This study is to determine the resolution of some kinematic variables. 

In particular, you can use it to determine the mass resolution which can then be used as an input to the PWA fits
  i.e. the width of the Gaussian constraint

It can also be used in our parameterization of a voigtian distribution if we wish to manually convolve a breit-wigner distribution as we do with these "simple/direct fits" to estimate the a2 cross section
